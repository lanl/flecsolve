The flecsolve package is a parallel computational framework for
multi-physics application development using the open source [FleCSI](https://flecsi.github.io/flecsi/)
programming system.  Flecsolve employs design principles from the [AMP](https://github.com/AdvancedMultiPhysics/AMP)
package to provide a lightweight set of tools for composing
multi-physics applications in FleCSI.  Specifically, flecsolve
provides a linear algebra interface to the FleCSI data abstraction.
This interface is used to implement a set of time integrators and
solvers for FleCSI applications.
